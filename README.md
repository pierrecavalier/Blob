# Blob project

As part of the second year of a double degree in mathematics and physics, with Rodolphe Alquier, Ancelin Balannec, Th√©o Contentin and Paul Hardy supervised by Olivier Guilbaud, we simulated the behaviour of a blob based on the Poiseuille equation.\\
By representing the block as an entity on a more or less square network with energy sinks and sources, we can represent the internal variations of the blob, which seeks to optimise its energy transport.
The subject and the report are available in French and trace the history of the various networks tested as well as the results obtained.

## Usage 

In the notebook "Projet commando.ipynb" you will find the different simulations, where the main difference is in the architecture of the blob, which changes from square to triangular to that of Delaunay, as well as in 3D.
