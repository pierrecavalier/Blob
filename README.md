# Blob project

As part of the second year of a double degree in mathematics and physics, with Rodolphe Alquier, Ancelin Balannec, Th√©o Contentin and Paul Hardy, we simulated the behaviour of a blob based on the Poiseuille equation.

The subject and the report are available in French and trace the history of the various networks tested as well as the results obtained.
